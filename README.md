## Project Overview
UFM (Unidentified Flying Mouse) is a wrist-worn computer input device designed for individuals with limited hand dexterity, those who have undergone hand amputation, or those who were born without a hand. The system converts movements from the arm to mouse functions and sends mouse commands to the user's PC over bluetooth.
